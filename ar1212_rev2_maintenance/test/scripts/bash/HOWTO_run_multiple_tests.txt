This folder contains bash scripts to semi-automate the process of running the 
Python integration tests and collating the results. Scripts are provided for
both the Simulator and the Virtual Prototype, in the 'sim' and 'model' 
directories respectively.

Each script executes a number of tests from a particular test group. The 
groups are listed in the TestSchedule (in test/scripts/TestSchedule.xls).
Note the scripts only execute the tests that were available when the AR0820
rev2 RC1.1 ROM was released. Numerous tests have been added since then but
the scripts have not been updated.

Each script has a common header section that defines the following environment
variables. These need to be configured to match the user's environment:

 - CODE_UNDER_TEST: the directory containing the AR0820 firmware SVN checkout
                    
 - DUT:             (sim-only) the directory containing the Secure TB environment 
                    SVN checkout
                    
 - MODEL_UNDER_TEST: (model-only) the directory containing the Virtual Prototype
                     model_build SVN checkout

 - TEST_RESULTS:    the directory to contain the test results. Typically this is
                    an empty directory named as rcYYY_rZZZ, when YYY is the SVN
                    revision of the firmware release candidate under test, and 
                    ZZZ is the SVN revision of the CODE_UNDER_TEST checkout.
                    
Each script also defines the following environment variables:

 - TEST_SCRIPT:     indicates the Python test script containing the test cases to
                    be executed (e.g. test_get_sensor_id)
 
 - TEST_CLASS:      indicates the Python test class (e.g. TestGetSensorId)
  
 - TEST_NAMES:      list of space-delimited tests to be executed, in the form 
                    <otpm_image>:<test_name> (e.g. blank:test_get_sensor_id_in_cm).
                    Each test must define which OTPM image it requires.

                    The TEST_NAMES variable can be extended to cover the full 
                    suite of tests within the test group (as and when necessary).

The scripts can be run from any directory, but the recommendation is to run them 
from your /sim/tmp/<username>/sim or /sim/tmp/<username>/model directories. The
results will be collated into the test_results directory (or wherever the 
TEST_RESULTS variable indicates).

The script parses the results of each test. If it finds the word 'failure' or 
'error' it aborts the script. Make sure none of your test cases contain these
words!
